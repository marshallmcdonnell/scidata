<h2>SciData Context Documents</h2>

<p>Importing context documents in JSON-LD files allows you to use the context for multiple documents.  This is the same way that XML (and JSON) schema work except the context is not defining rules of what the content of the JSON values can be, rather assigning semantic meaning to the values.</p>

<p>Below is a list of the current context files developed for the scientific data model.  Examples of each of these can be found on the examples page.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="scidata.jsonld">scidata.jsonld - The top level context that you need to include in each of your scidata documents</a></li>
</ul>
